# HDLBits Verilog Solutions

This repository contains my structured solutions to Verilog problems hosted on the [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/) website. The problems are organized folder-wise according to the categories and subcategories from the site. Each folder includes Verilog source code files for the corresponding questions.

Each file corresponds to a single problem and is named after the problem title (or a shortened version of it).
